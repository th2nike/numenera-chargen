## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numenera-chargen
cd numenera-chargen
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in `target/release/numenera-chargen` (or `.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Step-by-step character creation with guided prompts:

```bash
cargo run interactive
```

This will guide you through:
1. Character name
2. Character type selection
3. Descriptor or species selection
4. Bonus point allocation
5. Focus selection
6. Type ability selection

### Random Generation

Generate a completely random character:

```bash
cargo run random
```

Generate multiple random characters:

```bash
cargo run random -c 5
```

Generate a random character of a specific type:

```bash
cargo run random --type Glaive
cargo run random --type Nano
cargo run random --type Jack
```

Generate with specific type and descriptor:

```bash
cargo run random --type Glaive --descriptor Strong
```

### List Available Options

List all character types:

```bash
cargo run list types
```

List all descriptors:

```bash
cargo run list descriptors
```

List all foci:

```bash
cargo run list foci
```

List all species:

```bash
cargo run list species
```

List everything:

```bash
cargo run list all
```

### Validate Data Files

Check that all TOML data files are valid and properly formatted:

```bash
cargo run validate
```

### Show Application Info

Display version and feature information:

```bash
cargo run info
```

## Output

Characters are saved as Markdown files in the `output/` directory by default.

You can specify a custom output directory:

```bash
cargo run random --output my_characters
```

The generated Markdown files are compatible with Obsidian and other Markdown editors.

### Example Output

```markdown
# Anja Turunen

## Basic Information

- **Tier:** 1
- **Type:** Nano

| **Speed**     | 11 | 11 |
| **Intellect** | 18 | 18 |

...
```

## Development

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run tests with output:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Run specific test:

```bash
cargo test test_generate_random_character
```

Run data validation tests:

```bash
cargo test --test data_tests
```

## Data Files

All game data is stored in TOML files in the `data/` directory. These files follow the structure of the Numenera Discovery and Destiny rulebooks.

### Adding Custom Content

You can add your own custom descriptors, foci, or other content by editing the TOML files. Just follow the existing structure and run `cargo run validate` to ensure your additions are valid.
