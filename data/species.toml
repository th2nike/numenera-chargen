# ==========================================
# NOTES ON SPECIES USAGE
# ==========================================

# Species Usage:
# - When creating a Varjellen or Lattimor character, the species REPLACES the descriptor
# - When creating a Mutant character, "Mutant" REPLACES the descriptor
# - Regular human characters use standard descriptors (Charming, Clever, etc.)
# 
# Character sentence examples:
# - "I am a Varjellen Jack who Talks to Machines" (species replaces descriptor)
# - "I am a Lattimor Glaive who Masters Weaponry" (species replaces descriptor)
# - "I am a Mutant Nano who Bears a Halo of Fire" (species replaces descriptor)
# - "I am a Charming Arkus who Leads" (standard human with descriptor)
